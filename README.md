# Dissolution-and-Disintegerator-machine-control-and-testing
In this repository, dissolution and disintegerator code have been writen. Different files in this repository contains code for testing and validation code for disintegrator and dissolution machines. This code has been tested on LEDs, and push buttons using raspberry pi. In this case LED is assumed as an actuator while a push button is assumed a sensor. All the wiring of a circuit done on a bread board using jumper wires. Different sensors have been calibrated and tested, those sensor are mainly temperature, speed, humidity, and pressure.
